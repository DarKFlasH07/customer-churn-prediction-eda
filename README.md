Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of Customer Churn

## **Overview:**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in (OTT) subscription services,. Customer churn, the rate at which subscribers cancel their subscriptions, is a critical metric for the sustainability and growth of such services. Accurate churn prediction allows OTT platforms to proactively engage with at-risk customers and implement retention strategies, ultimately reducing revenue loss.

### **Key Highlights:**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, we have delved into the characteristics of OTT subscription data, uncovering patterns and trends related to customer behavior, content consumption, and engagement metrics. Insights gained from EDA inform our understanding of churn drivers.

- **Prediction Model:** Leveraging a diverse set of machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and more, we have developed a predictive model to forecast customer churn. This ensemble model combines insights from multiple algorithms and leverages historical subscriber data, content preferences, and user interactions to make accurate churn predictions. Model performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, showcase its effectiveness in capturing churn patterns across different facets of OTT subscription data.
